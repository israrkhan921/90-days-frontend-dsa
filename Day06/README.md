Day 06 – Linear Search & Dynamic Rendering

Today was all about connecting logic with UI.

I implemented Linear Search from scratch to fully understand how searching works internally — not just using built-in methods. It helped me think more clearly about loops, comparisons, and time complexity (O(n)).

On the React side, I focused on rendering arrays dynamically using .map() and properly using keys. I now understand why keys matter for performance and how React tracks list updates.

What I Built

A small React app that:

Renders a list of items dynamically

Takes user input

Runs a linear search when pressing Enter

Displays whether the item exists and its index

What Clicked Today

I’m starting to see how DSA isn’t separate from frontend — it powers the logic behind real UI behavior.

Small project, but big clarity.
