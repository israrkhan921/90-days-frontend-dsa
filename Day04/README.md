Day 04

Today is Day 04 of my 90-day frontend learning journey.
The focus for today was understanding the two-pointer technique in DSA and event handling in React, and then using both in a small interactive project.

What I worked on today
DSA – Two Pointer Technique

I practiced problems where two pointers are used instead of nested loops.
This helped me understand how to reduce time complexity and write cleaner, more efficient logic when working with arrays.

React – Event Handling

I learned how to handle user actions in React, such as:

Clicking buttons

Typing in input fields

Updating state using useState

I focused on keeping logic separate from JSX to make the component easier to read and maintain.

Mini Project – Interactive Array Component

I built a simple React component where:

Users can add numbers to an array

The array can be reversed using the two-pointer approach

The UI updates instantly based on user actions

The goal wasn’t design, but understanding how DSA logic fits into a React component.

Concepts used

Two-pointer technique

React state management (useState)

Event handling (onClick, onChange)

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)

Why this day was important

This day helped me connect problem-solving concepts with real frontend development.
Instead of solving DSA problems only on platforms, I applied the logic directly inside a React project.

Goal

I’m learning consistently to improve my frontend skills and work toward a remote Frontend Developer role with global companies.
