# Day 03 – Progress Log

Today was about making things **interactive**.

### What I learned

* How to add and remove elements from arrays
* The difference between `slice` (safe) and `splice` (mutates data)
* Why the spread operator (`...`) is important for copying arrays
* How `useState` works and why React needs immutable updates

### What I built

I created a simple **Counter component** where I can:

* Increase the count
* Decrease the count
* See the UI update instantly using state

### Key takeaway

Understanding arrays made `useState` finally click. JavaScript fundamentals really matter when working with React.

Next up: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` 🚀
