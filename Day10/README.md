Day 10 of 90 — useArraySum Custom Hook
Overview

On Day 10, I combined DSA and React concepts to create a custom hook that calculates the maximum sum of a subarray. This project demonstrates how algorithmic thinking can be integrated into reusable React logic.

Topics Covered

DSA: Max Sum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)

React: Custom Hooks

Project

useArraySum Hook

Calculates the sum of an array or maximum sum of a contiguous subarray

Designed to be clean, reusable, and easy to integrate into any React component

Key Concepts Learned

Understanding Kadane’s Algorithm

Creating custom hooks in React

Separating logic from UI for clean and maintainable code
