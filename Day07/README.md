Day 7 — Sorting & React Forms
Overview

This project is part of my 90-day frontend journey.
Today I focused on combining Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with React fundamentals. The goal was to practice basic sorting algorithms and controlled inputs by building an interactive form that adds numbers to an array and sorts them dynamically.

What I Learned
1. DSA: Sorting Basics

I practiced Bubble Sort and Selection Sort:

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Selection Sort: Finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and moves it to the correct position.

These algorithms help me understand how sorting works step by step and how to manipulate arrays programmatically.

2. React: Forms & Controlled Inputs

I built a React form to add numbers to an array. Key concepts:

Controlled Inputs: The input field value is stored in React state (useState) and updated on every change.

State Management: Using useState to store the array of numbers.

Dynamic Rendering: Array items are displayed automatically when the state updates.

This reinforced how React re-renders components when state changes and how to manage user input effectively.

Project Features

Add numbers: Users can type a number and click “Add Number” to append it to the array.

Sort the array: Users can click the “Sort Array” button to sort the array using Bubble Sort.

View array: The array items are displayed in a list dynamically.

State-driven UI: Updates happen automatically when the array changes.
