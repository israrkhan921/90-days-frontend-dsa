# Day 2 – Arrays & React Props 🚀

This is **Day 2** of my **90-Day Frontend Developer Journey**, where I’m focusing on building strong fundamentals in **DSA + React** and connecting logic with real UI components.

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today

### 🔹 DSA (Arrays)
- Calculated **sum**, **minimum**, and **maximum** values in an array
- Practiced looping through arrays using a manual approach
- Understood why `O(n)` time complexity matters
- Explored modern JavaScript methods like `reduce()`, `Math.min()`, and `Math.max()`

### 🔹 React
- Learned how **functional components** work
- Understood **props** and how data flows from parent to child
- Used **destructuring** for cleaner and more readable components

## 🛠️ Mini Project – ArrayDisplay Component

I built a small React component called **ArrayDisplay** that:
- Receives an array through props
- Displays the array values
- Calculates and shows:
  - Sum
  - Minimum value
  - Maximum value

This helped me connect **DSA logic with real frontend UI**, just like in real-world applications.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- DSA is not just for interviews — it’s used directly in UI logic
- Props make React components reusable and dynamic
- Clean UI comes from clean data handling

---

## 📂 Tech Used
- JavaScript
- React (Functional Components)
- JSX

---

## 🎯 Goal
I’m consistently improving my frontend skills to land a **remote Frontend Developer role at a global company** 🌍  
One day at a time. One commit at a time.
