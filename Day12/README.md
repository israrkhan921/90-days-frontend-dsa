Day 12 – Prefix Sums & React Performance 🚀

Today was all about improving both problem-solving skills and frontend performance.

📌 DSA: Prefix Sums

I learned how prefix sums work and why they’re powerful for range sum queries. Instead of recalculating sums every time (O(n)), we can preprocess once and answer queries in O(1). It really changed how I think about array problems — preprocess smartly, then query fast.

Key takeaway:

Precompute cumulative sums

Use subtraction to get any range sum efficiently

⚛️ React: Performance Optimization

Focused on reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving component efficiency.

Covered:

React.memo

useMemo

useCallback

Avoiding inline functions

Understanding when components re-render

It helped me realize that performance is mostly about avoiding extra work.

🛠 Project: Optimized Array Display Component

Applied both concepts by optimizing an array display component:

Prevented unnecessary re-renders

Improved rendering logic

Made the component cleaner and more efficient

Day 12 complete.
Small improvements every day add up. 💪
