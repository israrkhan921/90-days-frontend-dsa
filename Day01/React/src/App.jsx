    // what is React?
    // React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance, making it a popular choice for building modern web applications.

    // what is jsx?
    // JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files. JSX makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of the user interface in React applications. It is transpiled into regular JavaScript by tools like Babel before being executed in the browser.
