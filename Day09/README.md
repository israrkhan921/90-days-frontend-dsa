Day 09

Today was all about connecting algorithms with frontend development. I focused on two main things: removing duplicates from arrays and managing global state in React using Context API.

I learned how Set can be used to quickly remove duplicate values from an array. It’s simple but super powerful, especially when you need clean data for your application.

On the React side, I explored the Context API. It allowed me to store data globally and share it across components without passing props manually. This made my components cleaner and easier to manage.

For my mini project, I combined both concepts: I created a global array state that automatically removes duplicates before saving, so any component can access a clean, updated array.

Key takeaways from today:

DSA logic can be applied directly in frontend apps.

Context API is a simple and effective way to manage global state.

Keeping logic inside providers keeps components clean and reusable.

Understanding file structure and data flow is essential for scalable React apps.

Day 9 helped me see how algorithms and frontend architecture work together in real projects.
